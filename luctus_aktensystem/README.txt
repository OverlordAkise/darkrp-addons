# luctus_aktensystem

This is a "police documents" system.  
Admins and configured jobs can create "reports" for each player (which are basically files that document a player's wrongdoings in RP)

If you press the left ALT button then all the open windows will move into the background and you can talk/move/shoot while they are visible. Press ALT to focus the windows again.  
You can resize the windows by dragging them on the bottom right corner.

By default the menu opens with "!akten" or the F7 key.  
If you click on "View reports" of a player then only reports of the player in their current job will show. 
If you want to see all the reports of a player from any job then select "Search offline player" at the bottom of the main menu.
