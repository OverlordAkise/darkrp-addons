# luctus ulx extras

This addon was heavily inspired by other ulx-extra and ulx-darkrp addons.  

This addon only includes "important" ulx commands and doesn't have any many unnecessary or fun commands.  
It includes neither exploitable net messages nor any non-ulx code, which should make this more safe than alternatives.
