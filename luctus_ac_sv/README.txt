# Luctus Anticheat Serverside

HINT: It is recommended to make this addon load first, one way is to rename it like "_ac_sv".

This is an addon that helps you against exploits, backdoors and similar.  
No anticheat can be 100% secure, and this one is no exception. It tries its best to protect you from malicious actors, but it can not guarantee security.

Main functionalities are alerting (and protecting) against dynamic code execution and variable overwriting (before intrusion and after intrusion).  
This means that this addon tries to protect you from someone trying to use a backdoor and from someone who has already used it.
