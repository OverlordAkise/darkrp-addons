# Luctus Anticheat Serverside

HINT: It is recommended to rename this addon so that it gets loaded first (e.g. _ac_sv)

This is an addon that is supposed to alert you if a malicious actor is trying to overwrite important server functions.  
The main goal is not to prevent backdoors but to alert if one is being used in a bad way.

The HTTP debug functionality could create problems with vcmod and similar addons that use a DRM system, please disable it in this case.
