# luctus_wheel

This addon is more of a library than a feature-ready addon.  
It enables you to have a quick-selection menu by pressing E on an entity.  
This menu can be controlled via the mousewheel. By pressing E again you execute the selected entry.

Example usage:

 - Pressing E on a door can either use, buy, sell or lock it
 - Pressing E on a player can greet them or pay them
 - Pressing E on a weapon can either equip it or put it in your inventory
