## Warning
If you find a bug please submit an Issue on github!  
I will provide free and fast support if you find a bug!

## addons
The addons do what they are named after.  
Some have a README.txt inside that explains further what it does and what workshop items it needs to function correctly.

## _fixes
This folder has fixes for common exploits in it. Only use them if you have the corresponding addon installed!  
Put the file with the correct prefix (sh,sv,cl) into the corresponding autorun folder.

## _scripts
This folder includes small scripts which are not worthy of it's own addon.  
Put the file with the correct prefix (sh,sv,cl) into the corresponding autorun folder.

#_ext_addons
This folder has "external addons" in it. **I did NOT make these addons**, I found them, fixed them / rewrote them and re-uploaded them.
This folder currently includes:
 - contextmenumenu - a menu if you hold C (contextmenu) which enables you to do stuff without chat commands. Sadly no clue who made it.
 - tcb_f4menu - The F4 menu from TheCodingBeast. I moved the files from his github into an addon structure and fixed the F4 toggle-button not always toggling the menu.
 - essential_f4menu - This addon was removed from the workshop. I fixed the Cooking section always being visible, even if you are not a cook.
 - money-leaderboard - A leaderboard a friend sent me where I added Blue's ATMs to the counter. This makes it a "global atm+wallet" money leaderboard. (It's not optimized well because Blue puts everything in a single JSON field in his database)
 - kshop - a fixed version of kiwontatv's kshop. The workshop version has a big exploit that allows players to buy anything from anywhere for 0$.
 - meth_lab - a fixed version of a popular meth_lab addon.
