### Warning
These addons are tested by me on my own server. They are not thoroughly tested with 40+ players and 100 addons.  
If you find a bug please submit an Issue on github!

# _fixes
This folder has fixes for common exploits in it. Only use them if you have the corresponding addon installed!
Current fixes: Advanced Duplicator 2 crash, Bunnyhopping, Simple Thirdperson Wallhack

# _scripts
This folder includes small scripts which are not worthy of it's own addon.
Currently includes: Auto-bind T to toggle thirdperson, only allow admins to spawn props

#_ext_addons
This folder has "external addons" in it. **I did NOT make these addons**, I found them, fixed them / rewrote them and re-uploaded them.
This folder currently includes:
 - contextmenumenu - a menu if you hold C (contextmenu) which enables you to do stuff without chat commands. Sadly no clue who made it.
 - tcb_f4menu - The F4 menu from TheCodingBeast. I moved the files from his github into an addon structure and fixed the F4 toggle-button not always toggling the menu.
 - essential_f4menu - This addon was removed from the workshop. I fixed the Cooking section always being visible, even if you are not a cook.
 - money-leaderboard - A leaderboard a friend sent me where I added Blue's ATMs to the counter. This makes it a "global atm+wallet" money leaderboard. (It's not optimized well because Blue puts everything in a single JSON field in his database)
