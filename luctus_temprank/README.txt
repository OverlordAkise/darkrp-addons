# luctus_temprank

**WARNING**: This addon requires ulx !

This is a simple addon that gives a player a rank for a specified duration.

The ulx command takes the duration in minutes.  
You can only have one temporary rank. If you get another the previous one will be deleted.  
If your temprank expires your rank will be set to the one before getting your last temporary rank.
